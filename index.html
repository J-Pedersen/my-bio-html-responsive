                        <h3>Cooking</h3>
                        <p>I love to cook. I regularly find myself just cooking stuff to freeze or to give away because I felt like making it.
                            When I do cook you can be assured that it will not be health food because I have not mastered the ability to make 
                            food taste good without adding a pound of butter and tons of salt. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The way I see it we only live once and if I am eating food I am not enjoying just to stay healthier and live longer 
                            what is the point in existing longer if you are depriving yourself of some of the things which make life worth living.
                        </p>

                        <h3>WoodWorking</h3>
                        <p>Some people read, others play games and the list goes on. Woodworking in my workshop is where I go to relax and get 
                            away from the stress which build up daily and doesnt seem to have an outlet. It would be nice if I had the time to 
                            do wood working more regularly but I am extremely busy and I basically am doing other things from like 4am until 
                            midnight 7 days a week.</p>
                        <p>When I have on rare occations have time to spend in my shop I have made some pretty nice pieces of furniture. People 
                            have told me "you should make those things to sell them you would make a lot of money" but what they don't understand 
                            is that I don't build things for money. I build things because i had an idea and I wanted to create it. Also if i did 
                            build things for money I would have to chage 10 times what they are worth to make it profitable because I will 
                            sometimes work on a piece of furniture off and on for over a year before I call it good. Its never really done 
                            because I know where all the flaws are and they will always bother me so at some point I just have to stop myself 
                            and say this is done.</p>

                        <h3>Technology</h3>
                        <p>I have from a young age always been interest in technology. I had never owned a computer I did not build until 
                            this last year when I broke down and bought a laptop so I could do school work even when I wasn't at home.
                        </p>
                        <p>Video games were once something I spent far too many hours a day playing but I have found that i don't really 
                            have the time I used to to play them. Maybe once I retire. The exists a competetivness between my brother and I 
                            in regards to technology. Mine always has to be better. I get a newer bigger tv so he follows suit. I build a 
                            home theatre so he does the same. Eventually he might understand that I will never let him win.

                        <h3>Repair Technician</h3>
                        <p>I worked various jobs in home repair and maintenence from the time I was about 16 until til I was about 20. 
                            Which is when I became a Repair Technician. I have always had a mechanical apptitude. I can fix just about anything.

                        <p>That is but a small list of the things I have repaired frequently of the past 25 years. 
                            There is a lot more but the point is if i can't fix it, it isn't broken.

                        <h3>Associate Web Developer</h3>
                        <p>In 2014 after 20+ years of being a Repair Technician I was given the oppertunity to go back to school because there was a 
                            program which would pay for it. I choose to get my Associate's Degree in Web Devlopment. 
                            It was 100% paid for without any money coming out of my pocket so it was really an oppertunity which I would have been a fool 
                            to pass up the offer.
                        </p>
                        <p>It took me about a year to finish my Associates Degree and I was working fulltime while going to school. After I graduated I 
                            never really put the efforts needed into doing anything with that degree or tried to continue my education because I had a 
                            fulltime job which I was very skilled at and I was already making a very good living doing it.</p>
                        <p>Now that I am getting older I find myself regreting that decision to not push my education further because I am getting too 
                            old to be crawling on the floor under equipment to repair it. Which is why I am now going back to college to have the ability 
                            to still work but from my desk chair.

                        <h3>Handyman</h3>
                        <p>I like to to consider myself a jack of all trades. I have done many different home repairs and general home maintainence jobs over the years 
                            for both my own home and as side work for customers as side work.
                            <Ul class="list">

                        </p>
                        <p>I still occationally will do the odd job or repair for friends and family but really my freetime is too valuable and frankly infrequent to be 
                            spent working on someone elses home when there is still so much I want to do in my own home so typically if asked I will decline. 
                            Unless it is an emergency. Then my sypathetic nature gets the better of me and I will rearrange my life to help them out.
